# --- Advanced Math Test ---

# 1. Basic Prior Operations
set basic = 10
set priority = 10 + 5 * 2
print(priority) 
# Answer: 20 (because  5*2=10, then  10+10=20)
# if wrong (flat left-to-right): 30

# 2. Simple Parenthesis
set parens = (10 + 5) * 2
print(parens)
# Answer: 30

# 3. Complex Parenthesis Operation 
set complex = ((10 + 2) * 5) / (2 + 1)
print(complex)
# Logic: (12 * 5) / 3 -> 60 / 3 -> 20

# 4. multiple calculations
set a = 5
set b = 4
set c = a * b + a
print(c)
# Answer: 25

# 5. Assosiate Operations
set sub = 100 - 50 - 10
print(sub)
# Answer: 40
